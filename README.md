Responsive web design is about creating web pages that look good on all devices!
Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones).
A responsive web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewports.
