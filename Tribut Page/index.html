            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>Born:</em>
                    Ronald James "Dio" Padavona was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire,
                    to Italian-American parents from Cortland, New York.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Early life:</em>
                    Padavona listened to a great deal of opera while growing up,
                    and was influenced vocally by American tenor Mario Lanza.
                    His first formal musical training began at age 5, learning to play the trumpet.
                    It was also during high school that Padavona formed his first rock-n-roll group,
                    The Vegas Kings, which would later be named Ronnie and the Rumblers and
                    then Ronnie and the Red Caps.
                    Despite being known for his powerful singing voice,
                    Padavona claimed to have never received any vocal training.
                    He instead attributed his singing ability to the use of breathing techniques
                    he learned while playing trumpet
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Early career:</em>
                    Dio's musical career began in 1957, when several Cortland,
                    New York musicians formed the band, The Vegas Kings.
                    The group's lineup consisted of Dio on bass guitar, Billy DeWolfe on lead vocals,
                    Nick Pantas on guitar, Tom Rogers on drums, and Jack Musci on saxophone.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Rainbow:</em>
                    In the mid-1970s Dio's vocals caught the ear of Deep Purple
                    guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, who was planning on leaving Deep Purple
                    due to creative differences over the band's new direction. Blackmore
                    invited Dio along with Gary Driscoll to record two songs in Tampa,
                    Florida on December 12,1974. They released the self-titled debut album Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow
                    in early 1975.

                <li>
                    <em>Black Sabbath:</em>
                    Following his departure from Rainbow in 1979,

                    Following his departure from Rainbow in 1979,

                <li>
                    <em>Heaven and Hell:</em>
                    In October 2006, Dio joined Black Sabbath members
                    Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and former Black Sabbath drummer Vinny Appice
                    to tour under the moniker Heaven and Hell, the title of the first Dio era
                    Black Sabbath album.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Illness and death:</em>
                    On November 25, 2009, Dio announced that
                    he was diagnosed with stomach cancer[32] and underwent treatment at
                    the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.
                    Dio died of the illness on May 16, 2010.
